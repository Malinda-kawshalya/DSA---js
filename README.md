# Array Operations Practice

This project contains JavaScript examples demonstrating various array operations and methods.

## Files

- `array.js` - Contains examples of:
  - Basic array operations (push, pop, shift, unshift, splice)
  - Array iteration methods (for loop, while loop, forEach)
  - Functional array methods (map, filter, reduce, some)
  - Working with arrays of objects

## Array Methods Covered

### Basic Operations
- `push()` - Add elements to the end
- `pop()` - Remove elements from the end
- `unshift()` - Add elements to the beginning
- `shift()` - Remove elements from the beginning
- `splice()` - Add/remove elements at specific positions

### Functional Methods
- `map()` - Transform each element
- `filter()` - Select elements based on conditions
- `reduce()` - Reduce array to a single value
- `forEach()` - Execute function for each element
- `some()` - Test if at least one element meets condition

## How to Run

```bash
node array.js
```

## Examples

The code includes practical examples with a student data structure demonstrating:
- Converting names to uppercase
- Filtering students by marks
- Calculating total marks
- Checking if any student has marks above a threshold
